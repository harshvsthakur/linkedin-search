# linkedin-search

Made this simple code so I can connect with all Alumnis from say a perticular location

This is done via a code to extract all linked In profile details on a query page and to export to csv / excel sheet.

Step 1 : Get the link of the search query with applied filters of location / institute / industry etc. 

Step 2 : Run the code

I have separated it into functions since i generally use iPython for scraping. 

Currently the code extracts the following information : 
1. Name
2. Current working profile / designation
3. Location
4. Employment History
5. Education History
6. Profile URL
